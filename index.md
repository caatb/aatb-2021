## Advanced Architecture Birds of Feather 2021

This website provides the public face for Birds of Feather events for advanced architecture testbed Birds of Feather sessions at SC 2021. Please check back shortly for an agenda and timing!

In the meantime, you can revisit information on some of our previous BoFs [2019](https://github.com/caatb/aatb-bofs/blob/gh-pages/sc-2019-bof.md) and [2018](https://github.com/caatb/aatb-bofs/blob/gh-pages/sc-2018-bof.md) and also links to several [advanced architecture testbeds and the resources they offer](https://github.com/caatb/testbed-resources/blob/main/README.md).
