## Questions for the Panel

We also include some questions from previous BoFs to use as seed questions for further discussion.

1) What are the goals of your testbed program?  
2) How are your testbeds being prepared for exascale and post-exascale evaluations?  
    - (optional) If you could change one architectural component of your test bed to make it better, what would this component be and why?  
3) How are you envisioning using your testbeds to embrace co-design?  
4) What strategies are you using to evaluate AI workloads, especially with the influx of new AI accelerators?  
5) Lessons learned: Can you share the key successes and challenges experienced during your testbed programs?  

You can also revisit information on some of our previous BoFs [2019](https://github.com/caatb/aatb-bofs/blob/gh-pages/sc-2019-bof.md) and [2018](https://github.com/caatb/aatb-bofs/blob/gh-pages/sc-2018-bof.md) and also links to several [advanced architecture testbeds and the resources they offer](https://github.com/caatb/testbed-resources/blob/main/README.md).
